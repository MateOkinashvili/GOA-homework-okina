<h1>The Sinking of the Titanic</h1>

<hr>

<p>RMS Titanic sank on 15 April 1912 in the North Atlantic Ocean. The largest ocean liner in service at<br>
    the time, Titanic was four days into her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City, with an<br>
    estimated 2,224 people on board when she struck an iceberg at 23:40 (ship's time)[a] on 14 April.<br>
    Her sinking two hours and forty minutes later at 02:20 ship's time (05:18 GMT) on 15 April, resulted<br>
    in the deaths of more than 1,500 people, making it one of the deadliest peacetime maritime<br>
    disasters in history</p>

<p>Titanic received six warnings of sea ice on 14 April but was travelling at a speed of roughly 22 knots<br>
    (41 km/h) when her lookouts sighted the iceberg. Unable to turn quickly enough, the ship suffered a<br>
    glancing blow that buckled her starboard side and opened six of her sixteen compartments to the<br>
    sea. Titanic had been designed to stay afloat with up to four of her forward compartments flooded,<br>
    and the crew used distress flares and radio (wireless) messages to attract help as the passengers<br>
    were put into lifeboats. In accordance with existing practice, the Titanic's lifeboat system was<br>
    designed to ferry passengers to nearby rescue vessels, not to hold everyone on board<br>
    simultaneously; therefore, with the ship sinking rapidly and help still hours away, there was no safe<br>
    refuge for many of the passengers and crew with only twenty lifeboats, including four collapsible<br>
    lifeboats. Poor preparation for and management of the evacuation meant many boats were<br>
    launched before they were completely full.</p>

<p>Titanic sank with over a thousand passengers and crew still on board. Almost all of those who<br>
    ended up in the water died within minutes due to the effects of cold shock and incapacitation.<br>
    RMS Carpathia arrived about an hour and a half after the sinking and rescued all of the 710<br>
    survivors by 09:15 on 15 April. The disaster shocked the world and caused widespread outrage over<br>
    the lack of lifeboats, lax regulations, and the unequal treatment of third-class passengers during the<br>
    evacuation. Subsequent inquiries recommended sweeping changes to maritime regulations, leading<br>
    to the establishment in 1914 of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS)<br>
    which still governs maritime safety today.</p>
