<h3>Today's topic is my armwrestling journey</h3>
<p>When I first started armwrestling, i was very weak and frustrated.</p>
<p>I was being defeated in almost all the armwrestling tries.</p>
<h4>Getting to know ArmWrestling</h4>
<p>after i was defeated many times and watched people armwrestle, i wanted to know more about ArmWrestling.</p>
<p>I researched: techniques, workouts, tips</p>
<h5>Working Out</h5>
<p>I started working on technique and strength and started to see the results</p>
