        <h2>ArmWrestling</h2>

              <!-- Paragraph -->

        <p>Arm wrestling (also spelled armwrestling) is a sport with two opponents who face each other with their<br>
        bent elbows placed on a table and hands firmly gripped, who then attempt to force the opponent's hand<br>
        down to the table top ("pin" them). The sport is often casually used to demonstrate the stronger person<br>
        between two or more people.</p>

            <h2>Techniques</h2>

            <h3>Hook</h3>

            <p>The "hook" or "hooking" is any move classified within the "inside" style of arm wrestling. The defining<br>
                characteristic of a hook is supination of the hand and forearm, which results in a match centered on pressure<br>
                applied through the wrist. Generally, a successful hook is more dependent on raw arm strength (centered on the<br>
                biceps) than hand control and technique compared to a toproll.</p>

            <h3>Toproll</h3>

            <P>The "top roll" or "top rolling" is any move classified within the "outside" style of arm wrestling. The defining<br>
                characteristic of a toproll is pronation of the hand and forearm, in which the thumb becomes the point in which<br>
                pressure is applied as you rotate into the opponent's hand. Generally, a successful toproll is highly dependent on<br>
                technique and the strength of the hand and forearm, more so than a hook or press.

            </P>

            <h3>Press</h3>

            <p>The "triceps press", "shoulder pressing", or "shoulder rolling" is often described as the third primary move or<br>
                style of arm wrestling. The defining characteristic of a press is the rotation of the competitor's torso in order to<br>
                position their shoulder behind their hand. This position allows the athlete to better utilize their triceps strength<br>
                and body weight, and is usually only attempted in neutral or advantageous positions in order to finish an<br>
                opponent. A press can be accessed from either a hook or toproll.</p>
